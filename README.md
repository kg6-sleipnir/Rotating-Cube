I have always wanted to create a program like this, but I never knew the math required to make it until now. Now that I am taking a calc 3 course, I decided to try and apply what I was learning in a way that is visually interesting. Small projects like this help give me a sence of accomplishment when I get diminishing returns of satisfaction on bigger projects that take longer to complete.
